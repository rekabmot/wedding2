          <strong>Ladies and Gentlemen!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment you've all been waiting for!
        </p>
        <p>
          That's right folks, ten years after their first meeting, <strong>Baker vs Shannon</strong> will be held on
          <strong>Saturday 2nd February 2019</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were many out there who were convinced it was never going to happen, and that Tom would never get his
          arse in gear and pop the question. Even Auntie Arlene had almost given up hope! But in 2016, Tom finally got
          down on one knee and played the best game of Scrabble of his life. Sarah said "Yes" (eventually), and after a
          long engagement, the main event is not far away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>So dust off your morning suits, fix your fascinator, and get ready for the party of the year!</strong>

        <p>The North East of England has dozens of beautiful wedding destinations.</p>
        <p>
          However, located within the countryside of County Durham, <strong>Beamish Hall Hotel</strong> is definitely
          among the most special.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel, which is a stones throw away from Beamish Open Air Museum is a converted 13th century manor house.
          The wedding ceremony will take place in the Shafto Hall, with the wedding breakfast and reception following
          afterwards in the Winter Gardens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tom and Sarah have booked exclusive use of the hotel for the day of the wedding, meaning that the only people
          on site will be their families and friends. If you've been invited to stay at the hotel on the night of the
          wedding, you should have received information from the bride or groom. If not, please get in touch ASAP!

        <h2>Gifts</h2>
        <p>
          Tom and Sarah have been together a long time. I mean, a <strong>really</strong> long time. That said, they
          have plenty of cutlery and crockery. Between them, they also have <strong>way</strong> too much booze!
        </p>
        <p>
          The absolute <strong>best</strong> gift you could possibly give them on their wedding day is the
          <strong>pleasure of your company</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just being there would mean the world to both of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feel you really must give something, then please consider making a contribution towards the
          honeymoon.
